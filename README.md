This folder contains the SQL and Python code created for the final exam project for Data Management and Visualization. Please note, the Python code uses the original listings CSV file shared for this assignment. To run the code, the file path might need to be adapted according to the user's local machine. The SQL code uses the CSV file df_listings_er created through the Python code. Here again, the file path under the COPY command needs to be updated accordingly.
